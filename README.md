# React Daily Learning Progress

This repository documents my **daily progress** as I learn React through:
- Projects from the Meta Front-End Developer Program
- Personal micro-projects (components, hooks, state, effects)
- Practical implementations of core concepts (props, forms, state, conditional rendering, routing)

Each file represents a new day or topic:
- `Day 1 - JSX Basics`
- `Day 3 - useState Deep Dive`
- `Day 7 - Conditional Rendering & Event Handling`
- And more...

## ðŸ’¼ Why This Matters

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Trying to Achieve

- Build components the way real companies do â€” clean, tested, reusable
- Understand *why* React works the way it does, not just how
- Document my learning journey publicly to stay accountable
- Turn this repo into proof-of-skill for clients and other opportunities
